# Floaty.js
## By Tyler Zeller

Floaty is a pure JavaScript library for adding dynamic, floating elements to your webpage. The behavior of the elements that you choose as Floaties is similar to Apple's assistive touch or Facebook's chat head bubbles.

### Quick Start Guide

To use Floaty.js, download floaty.js and floaty.css and add them to your webpage project.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylermzeller/floaty/master/floaty.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylermzeller/floaty/master/floaty.css">
```

Then add a `floaty` id to the element you wish to become a Floaty.

`<div id="floaty"></div>`

That's it! Notice that currently Floaty.js only works with ids, meaning you may only have one floaty per page. I am working to change this and allow multiple Floaties on a single webpage.
